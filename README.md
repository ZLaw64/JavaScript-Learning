# JavaScript-Learning
Learning JavaScript. Plan on doing at least one exercise a day
These exercises are from w3resource. Main goal is for me to code everyday, even when I know I could blitz a lot of these problems in day (well, maybe haha).
Using minimal HTML and CSS. Soon, I will be making a personal blog and portfolio page.
Another goal is just get use to the work environment. Learn to google more and make commits on git.
I decided to revisit Jonas Schmedtmann's udemy course I had for years. Only going to stick with that tutorial.

As of 12.09.23, 03:06, I am on 18. Taking Decisions: if / else Statements.
Personally was going to start on the commits for the first exercise on w3resource but the solution requires the knowledge of arrays. I vaugely remember how to use them but I want to sync the exercise from w3resource with my ongoing tutorial consumption. For now, I will simultaneously wrong on a blog and learn JS. This is a habit I want to get in the groove for.
