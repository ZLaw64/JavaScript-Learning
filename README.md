# JavaScript-Learning
Learning JavaScript. Plan on doing at least one exercise a day
These exercises are from w3resource. Main goal is for me to code everyday, even when I know I could blitz a lot of these problems in day (well, maybe haha).
Using minimal HTML and CSS. Soon, I will be making a personal blog and portfolio page.
Another goal is just get use to the work environment. Learn to google more and make commits on git.
I decided to revisit Jonas Schmedtmann's udemy course I had for years. Only going to stick with that tutorial in terms of javascript.

As of 12.09.2023, 03:06, I am on Lecture 18. Taking Decisions: if / else Statements.
Personally was going to start on the commits for the first exercise on w3resource but the solution requires the knowledge of arrays. I vaugely remember how to use them but I want to sync the exercise from w3resource with my ongoing tutorial consumption. For now, I will simultaneously wrong on a blog and learn JS. This is a habit I want to get in the groove for.

As of 12.10.2023 19:43, I am on Lecture 37. Reviewing Functions.
Spent the day taking my time with the lessons and doing his exercises of what I learned. Going to be a bit till I put javascript into the browser as I am still using console.log haha. Personally, I was going to spend most of the day on working on the blog I have in mind but this worked out better as I feel like creating a strong understanding of javascript will keep me more active. It seems that the DOM and Events Fundamentals lessons will be on Lecture 68, so it will take me a bit till I get there. I have work in about 2-3 hours, so when it is lunch time, I will get thru one lesson and then setup a layout for my blog in mind while using git. 
So far I have no deep thoughts about the lessons I learned about javascript except I have a stronger understanding of the material. It helps that I am no longer mindlessly going through the tutorial. Maybe during lunch, I can practice googling and implement JS in my baby website.
